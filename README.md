### What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is basically an extension of the Spring framework which eliminated the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that helps developers build Spring-based applications quickly and easily. The main goal of Spring Boot is to quickly create Spring-based applications without requiring developers to write the same boilerplate configuration again and again.



### What is Spring MVC?

Spring MVC is a popular module in Spring Framework and it is used to develop web applications as well as RESTful web services.

Spring MVC is called a web framework because it provides all the required components to develop a complete web application.

The Spring MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications



### What is Thymeleaf?

Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and even plain text.

The main goal of Thymeleaf is to provide an elegant and highly-maintainable way of creating templates.

It's commonly used to generate HTML views for web applications.

Thymeleaf is a very popular choice for building UI so we will be using Thymeleaf to build the view layer in the Spring MVC web application (Blog App).
